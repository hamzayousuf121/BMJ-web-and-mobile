1) Make Preodic Table as shown in figure (you can put the colors in the table cell using "bgcolor" attribute)
2) Download one image and display that image with width(500,400,300,200,100) means you have to show that image five times along with the caption
3) Make the form as shown in figure with the "get" method (don't care for the styling part just make the 'fields' in form)
