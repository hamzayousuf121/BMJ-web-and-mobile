                Fatima Jinnah (Urdu: فاطمہ جناح‎; 31 July 1893 – 9 July 1967),[1] widely known as Māder-e Millat
                ("Mother of the Nation"), was a Pakistani dental surgeon, biographer, stateswoman, and one of the
                leading founders of Pakistan.[2] She was the younger sister of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. After
                obtaining a dental degree from University of Calcutta in 1923,[3] she became a close associate and an
                adviser to her older brother, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who later became the first Governor General of
                Pakistan. A strong critic of the British Raj, she emerged as a strong advocate of the two nation theory
                and a leading member of the All-India Muslim League.[1]

                After the independence of Pakistan, Jinnah co-founded the Pakistan Women's Association which played an
                integral role in the settlement of the women migrants in the newly formed country. She remained the
                closest confidant of her brother until his death. After his death, Fatima was banned from addressing the
                nation until 1951; her 1951 radio address to the nation was heavily censored by the Liaquat
                administration.[4] She wrote the book My Brother, in 1955 but it was only published 32 years later, in
                1987, due to censorship by the establishment, who had accused Fatima of 'anti-nationalist material'.
                Even when published several pages from the book's manuscript were left out.[5]

            (Næʍābzādāh ی خان‎ ; 1 October 1895 – 16 October 1951), widely known as Quaid-e-Millat (Leader of the
            Nation) and Shaheed-e-Millat[1] (Urdu: شہِیدِ مِلّت‎ Martyr of the Nation), was one of the leading founding
            fathers of Pakistan,[2] statesman, lawyer, and political theorist who became the first Prime Minister of
            Pakistan; he also held cabinet portfolio as the first foreign, defence, and the frontier regions minister
            from 1947 until his assassination in 1951.[2][2] Prior to the partition, Khan briefly tenured as the first
            finance minister in the interim government led by its Governor General Mountbatten.[2]

            He was born into an influential aristocratic Muslim family in Karnal, Eastern Punjab on 1 October 1895.[3]
            Liaquat Ali Khan was educated at the Aligarh Muslim University in India, and then at Oxford University in
            the United Kingdom.[citation needed] Well-educated, he was a democratic political theorist who promoted
            parliamentarism in India. After first being invited by the Congress Party, he opted for the Muslim League
            led by influential Mohammad Ali Jinnah who was advocating the eradication of the injustices and
            ill-treatment meted out to Indian Muslims by the British government.[4] He pursued his role in the
            independence movements of India and Pakistan, while serving as the first Finance Minister in the interim
            government of British Indian Empire, prior to the independence and partition of India and Pakistan in
            1947.[4] Ali Khan assisted Jinnah in campaigning for the creation of a separate state for Indian Muslims.[5]

            Ali Khan's credentials secured him the appointment of Pakistan's first Prime Minister, Ali Khan's foreign

            <p id="iqbal">Muhammad Iqbal (KB) (/ˈɪkbɑːl/; Urdu: محمد اِقبال‎; 9 November 1877 – 21 April 1938), widely known as
                Allama Iqbal, was a poet, philosopher and politician, as well as an academic, barrister and
                scholar[1][2] in British India who is widely regarded as having inspired the Pakistan Movement. He is
                called the "Spiritual Father of Pakistan."[3] He is considered one of the most important figures in Urdu
                literature,[4] with literary work in both Urdu and Persian.[2][4]
                Iqbal is admired as a prominent poet by Indians, Pakistanis, Iranians, Bangladeshis and other
                international scholars of literature.[5][6][7] Though Iqbal is best known as an eminent poet, he is also
                a highly acclaimed "Muslim philosophical thinker of modern times".[2][7] His first poetry book, The
                Secrets of the Self, appeared in the Persian language in 1915, and other books of poetry include The
                Secrets of Selflessness, Message from the East and Persian Psalms. Amongst these, his best known Urdu
                works are The Call of the Marching Bell, Gabriel's Wing, The Rod of Moses and a part of Gift from
                Hijaz.[8] Along with his Urdu and Persian poetry, his Urdu and English lectures and letters have been
                very influential in cultural, social, religious and political discourses.</p>

            <p id="azam">Muhammad Ali Jinnah (born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948) was a barrister,
                politician and the founder of Pakistan.[2] Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League
                from 1913 until Pakistan's creation on 14 August 1947, and then as Pakistan's first Governor-General
                until his death. He is revered in Pakistan as Quaid-i-Azam ("Great Leader") and Baba-i-Qaum, ("Father of
                the Nation"). His birthday is considered a national holiday in Pakistan.[3][4]

                Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London. Upon his
                return to British India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national
                politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National
                Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career,
                Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the
                All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the
                All India Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the
                political rights of Muslims. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to
                follow a campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.</p>
